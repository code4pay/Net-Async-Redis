    BREAKING CHANGES:

    - the event bus API is no longer supported - if you have any code using this,
    please see the subscription documentation for alternatives.

    New features:

    - server implementation, currently supports only a subset of commands and
    is mostly intended to provide a way to unit-test codepaths in Redis client
    code.
    - updated to June 2018 commands (redis 5.0 including memory debug, consumer
    groups and bzpop)


1.006     2018-07-12 22:39:10+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - PSUBSCRIBE wasn't working (reported by Bill Marriott and leonerd, fix+tests by leonerd,
    I did little more than hit the merge button - thanks!)

    Dependencies:

    - Math::Random::Secure dep was missing (thanks MANWAR!)

1.005     2018-01-06 18:18:22+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Dependencies:

    - Class::Method::Modifiers, and make sure we have a recent version of Future.pm

1.004     2017-12-29 20:10:42+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Performance improvements:

    - DISCARD/EXEC are now pipelined, we don't need to wait for the
    write before sending more commands


1.003     2017-12-26 18:00:36+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - support queuing for MULTI and other commands
    - support for passing a Redis URI
    - minor performance improvements in protocol implementation and event handling

    Bugs fixed:

    - it was possible for cancelled/failed items within ->multi to cause the protocol
    handling to go out of sync, this is now fixed.
    - multi-word commands were generated incorrectly, these now work again

    Examples:

    - `examples/job-hash-worker.pl` - reliable priority-queue worker with job
    details in separate hash key
    - `examples/job-hash-submit.pl` - submit requests for priority-queue workers


1.002     2017-12-11 06:06:47+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Dependencies:

    - Explicit Log::Any dependency to ensure that context support is available

    New features:

    - PSUBSCRIBE support

1.001     2017-12-11 05:38:20+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Dependencies:

    - Added Test::HexString and Test::Deep to test deps list

    New features:

    - Support for MULTI transactions via ->multi method

    Examples:

    - `examples/job-worker.pl` - Simple list-based job queue
    - `examples/multi.pl` - Transaction using MULTI

1.000     2017-12-09 16:51:40+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    First stable release. Note that there are some API changes, but
    previous code should work mostly unmodified.

    New features:

    - Dropped Protocol::Redis in favour of local implementation
    - Separated out commands into an autogenerated class to make
    it easier to keep up to date with protocol changes
    - Better support for subscriptions (see `examples/pub|sub.pl`)
    - Dropped JSON::MaybeXS and Mixin::Event::Dispatch deps, events
    are now handled through Ryu

    Known issues:

    - All data is assumed to be binary, callers need their own
    Encode::encode()/::decode() calls - future versions are likely
    to include an `->encoding` setting and/or `_utf8` versions of
    string methods.
